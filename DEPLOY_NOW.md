# âš¡ Deploy Now - Simple Steps

Your code is ready on GitHub. Render just needs to be told to deploy it.

---

## Do This Right Now:

### 1. Go to Render Dashboard
ðŸ‘‰ https://dashboard.render.com

### 2. Click Your Service
Look for: `trainer-client-dashboard` (or whatever your service is named)

### 3. Click "Manual Deploy"
Should be a button at the top right of the page

**OR** look for a dropdown that says "Deploy"

### 4. Select Branch: `main`
Then click the blue "Deploy" or "Deploy Latest Commit" button

### 5. Wait 2-3 Minutes
Watch it say "Deploying..." then "Live"

### 6. Click "Shell" (Left Sidebar)
Run this:
```bash
python3 add_templates_production.py
```

### 7. Done!
Go to your app â†’ Login â†’ See Templates!

## Why Didn't Auto-Deploy Work?

**Fix for next time:**
- In Render â†’ Your Service â†’ Settings
- Find "Auto-Deploy" toggle
- Make sure it's **ON** (blue)
- Save changes

---

## What You're Looking For:

**In Render Dashboard:**
- Service name (trainer-client-dashboard or similar)
- "Manual Deploy" button or "Deploy" dropdown
- After deploy: "Shell" button in left sidebar

**Expected Timeline:**
- Manual deploy: Click now
- Building: 1-2 minutes
- Status "Live": Ready!
- Run shell command: 30 seconds
- Test app: See new features!

---

## The Shell Command (Step 6):
```bash
python3 add_templates_production.py
```

This adds all 10 templates to your production database.
